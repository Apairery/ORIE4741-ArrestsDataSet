# Examining the NYPD Arrests Dataset

Group members: Varun Somani (vs472), Mengjia Xia (mx233), Binxin Liu (bl642)

We will use [NYC OpenData NYPD Arrests Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u), which records every arrest effected in NYC ranging from 01/01/2006 to 12/31/2018.

We want to see how the crime type has changed in a certain region over the 12 years the dataset presents.

This question is important because the dataset ranges from time the world was reeling from the massive financial collapse which was centered in NYC. We can examine how an increase in prosperity from that time to now has affected the type of crime committed.

See our [Project Proposal](https://github.com/s2c/ORIE4741-ArrestsDataSet/blob/master/project_proposal.pdf) for more detailed information.

This project is for [Fall 2019 ORIE 4741](https://github.com/ORIE4741/ProjectsFall2019).
